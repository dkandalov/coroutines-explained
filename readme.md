This repository contains 
[Keynote slides](https://github.com/dkandalov/coroutines-explained/blob/master/slides.key) 
and [source code](https://github.com/dkandalov/coroutines-explained/tree/master/src)
for Coroutines explained
talk presented at [ACCU 2018](https://conference.accu.org/2018/schedule.html)
and [SoCraTes UK 2018](http://socratesuk.org) conferences.
The code and slides on might not match the talk at the conference though 
because it has evolved since then (for exact match, you can check out `accu2018` tag).

If you have any problems running code examples, please feel free to get in touch or just create github issue.
