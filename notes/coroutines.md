### Outline
 - historical note (languages which have coroutines and languages which might get them in the future)
 - terms (?)
    - async vs sync (sequential, blocking) 
 - problems it solves (related to usecases, examples?)
    - no threads in js/lua
    - global lock in python
    - linux: 1M sockets, but only thousands on threads
        - switching to kernel mode and back is expensive
        - CPU cache misses
 - continuations
    - scheme examples
    - diagram
    - delimited (aka scoped) vs ...
 - coroutines
    - as a concept; diagram
		- Flavors of coroutines
		    - stackless (c#, scala, kotlin, ...) VS stackful (lisp, go, ...); are goroutines really coroutines or green threads?
		        Stackless:
	                - only local variables are available (one stack frame preserved)
                    - only top-level coroutine function can be suspended 
                    - no special stack handling is needed
                Stackful:
					- all stack frames above are also preserved
                    - can suspend from helper functions
                    - stack must be allocated on the side
		    - symmetric VS asymmetric
		      (An asymmetric coroutine knows its invoker, using a special operation to implicitly yield control specifically to its invoker. 
		      By contrast, all symmetric coroutines are equivalent; one symmetric coroutine may pass control to any other symmetric coroutine. 
		      Because of this, a symmetric coroutine must specify the coroutine to which it intends to yield control.)
    - concurrency vs parallelism (cooperative vs preemptive multitasking)
    - why use them?
        - single-threaded environment / global lock
        - cheaper than threads (e.g. if you need high level of concurrency), fibers; green-threads distinction
            - cheaper than "continuations" provided by OS
            - program-specific scheduling (unlike general-purpose platform/OS scheduler)
        - simpler code
            - generators
            - no nested callbacks
    - scheme coroutines via continuations
    - Lua and other languages examples
 - try/catch
    - coroutine composition
        - coTry() with nested coThrow() 
	- retriable exceptions (?)
 - ambiguous values (?)    
 - generators
    - basic example (differences between languages)
    - factorial stream example
    - stream from DB example
    - pull vs push (inverting control flow ü§î?)
 - async/await
    - basic example (differences between languages)
    - practical application (real world uses)
 - concurrency
    - thread = continuation (callstack) + scheduler 
	- actors
	- channels (like in Go)
	- dataflow / reactive
	- synchronous reactive programming (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronous_programming_language)
 - delimited continuations vs. monads
 - coroutines caveats
 - terminology and recap
    - CPS aka continuation passing style (don't confuse with "communicating sequential processes" aka CSP)
 - references 



### Look into
 - coroutines composability
    - compose better than monads
    - e.g. generator of ambiguous values


Try coroutines in:
 + Lua
    - https://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#pdf-coroutine.create
 + JS
 + C#
 + Python
    - async with/for
        - https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0492/#types-coroutine
    - http://www.dabeaz.com/coroutines/Coroutines.pdf
 -+ Go
 -+ Scheme
    - http://community.schemewiki.org/?call-with-current-continuation
 + Kotlin
 -+ C++ (boost)

### Timeline
 - 1958: According to Donald Knuth, Melvin Conway coined the term coroutine in 1958 when he applied it to construction of an assembly program.
 - 1963: The first published explanation of the coroutine appeared later, in 1963
 - 1972: Scheme (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Scheme_programming_language)
 - 2001: yield in Python 2.2 (https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.2) 
	- 2006: In Python 2.5, generators picked up some new features to allow "coroutines" (PEP-342). Most notably: a new send() method
 - 2005: yield in C# 2.0 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)#Versions)
 - 2012: async/await in C# 5.0 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)#Versions)
 - 2015: async/await in Python 3.5 (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0492/)
 - 2015: ECMAScript 2015 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript#Versions)
 
 - One of the large new features in PHP 5.5 will be support for generators and coroutines.
